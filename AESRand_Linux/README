This Linux version serves as a compact and simplified proof-of-concept
with far less verbosity than the Windows implementation. 

For more notes on why certain values were chosen, read the Windows
implementation

This Linux version is designed with maximum comptability, with
-march=westmere in the Makefile. -march=skylake (or any other AVX
computer) generates cleaner AVX instructions, but doesn't seem
to affect this test very much. Westmere CPUs were first released
on January 7, 2010, so I expect that most people's computers today
would be able to run this RNGAES code.

Try running with the "time" command. An example run on my machine is:

time ./AESRand
Running 5-billion iterations (160 Billion-bytes of Random Data)
Dummy print to negate optimizer: -535139616294573357

real    0m4.818s
user    0m4.797s
sys     0m0.000s

This gives a speed of 1.04 billion iterations/sec, or 33.2 GBps of
random data. My computer varies between 3.4GHz and 4GHz, so the code
runs somewhere between 3.5 cycles per iteration, to 4.15 cycles per
iteration. 

--------

AESRandGenerator is a 2nd program I wrote to be tested with TestU01's
"BigCrush". Its simply the generator that pipes its output to stdout
